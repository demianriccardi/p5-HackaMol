=head1 SYNOPSIS

   # instance of class that consumes the QmRole.
 
   $obj->basis_geom('spherical');
 
   $obj->basis_geom('cartesian');
 
   $obj->dummy('bq');
 
   print "dummy! "     if $obj->is_dummy;
 
   $obj->clear_dummy;
 
   print "not dummy! " unless $obj->is_dummy;
 
   $obj->basis('SDD');
 
   $obj->ecp('SDD');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

QmAtomRole provides attributes that will be useful for setting up interfaces to quantum chemistry
packages.  All attributes are 'rw' and lazy, so they will not contaminate the namespace unless 
called upon.  The functionality for QM calculations is extended in the QmMolRole. 
I have used earlier versions of these roles to load basis_sets and effective core potentials 
downloaded from the EMSL basis set exchange as a single Str. https://bse.pnl.gov/bse/portal

A dream is to interface with EMSL library directly.

=attr basis_geom

isa Str that is lazy and rw

=attr dummy
 
isa Str that is lazy and rw

=attr basis

isa Str that is lazy and rw

=attr ecp

isa Str that is lazy and rw
